# ethdappswap 
This is a starter kit inspired from [dappuniversity/starter_kit](https://github.com/dappuniversity/starter_kit) where most of the configurations are derived from `truffle init`. 🍄

## 👨‍🏫 Instructions 

1. Clone this repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. If you don't have `truffle` installed yet, go ahead and run `npm install -g truffle`.
2. We are using `identicon.js` to create identicons based from user's Ethereum address. Run `npm install --save identicon.js`
3. Get started and create your smart contracts! 👨‍💻
